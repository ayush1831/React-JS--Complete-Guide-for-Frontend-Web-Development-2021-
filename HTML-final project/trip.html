            <p id="trip">Dubai is often overlooked as a top travel destination for students, but it shouldn’t be! This ultramodern city is filled with shopping, nightlife and tons of things to see and do. Two more reasons why Dubai is a great city to visit: it’s a really safe city and most people speak English too. Plus, this year, it’s home to the massive World Expo, showcasing arts, culture, performances, food and more from over 190 different countries.
